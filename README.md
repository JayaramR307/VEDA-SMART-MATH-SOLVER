Partnership between AI and AR is likely to have a profound impact on customer experience.
AI enables AR to have a multidimensional interaction with the physical environment.
Demand for AR apps gradually increased.
Applications: Speech and Image recognition, Human pose estimation, Education.


Introducing Veda, an app which makes mathematics no more a nightmare.
Can be used by anyone who does mathematical problems; to improve learning and also cross check solutions.
Points the camera to a math problem, using the training model and databases stored, shows the step-by-step solution in real time using AR.
